Hello. :hand:  
My name is Takehiko Yoshida. :kissing_heart:

I am a freelance web developer.

I was involved in Java language development for 15 years and then Web front-end development for 3 years.
After that, I was involved in backend development of ruby(rails) and golang, and here I am now.

In my private life, I am passionate about video games and sometimes work while listening to the background music of retro games.

I am working hard everyday to get my hands on the Triforce of programming.
